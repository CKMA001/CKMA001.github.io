Hi，This is Chenkun Ma's Blog。 I'm currently a master student at the princeton school of architecture. I started this blog as an archive of my work for a class taught by Professor mitch mcewen on robotic fabrication. 

I decided to keep the hobby of writing blogs online as a complement to making stuff and keep track of various thought processes, which have been most likely forgotten. It is my wish that this blog can become a way to gather reflections  and investigations on the current trends in architecture, or just anything.
