Robotically fabricated recursive joint

<!--more-->

The author referred to Al-Khwarizimi as a process of reduction, categorizing mathematical solutions into six primitive types; the types of formulas can then be translated to spatial data by treating the formulas as geometrical problems.  The translation of mathematical equations into a thing that lacks any symbolic meaning seems like an interesting way to rethink the way that the current mode of AI and data collection is structured. Data are usually presented as abstract and symbolic forms categorized by numbers, and similarly, space is generally represented by specific points in Euclidean space. The product of fabrication thus depends on a certain degree of expertise in algebraic solutions. When formulas are presented in graphic means, The logic of AL-Khawarizmi can make abstract data respond to space, creating real-time interfaces between fabrication and digital inputs, reducing the need for expertise for solving algebra problems and allowing a more iterative mode of fabrication.
