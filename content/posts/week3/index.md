In “Black Feminist Tools, Critique, and Techno-poetics” ,Parisi and Ferreira argue that AI can either reactivate the racialization of names, jobs, and hairstyles or act as means of resistance, care, and liberation. AI has the potential to liberate humans from labor and focus on creative works, detaching from the commodification of capitalist society. They also argued for techno-poetic ways of using machines which use technology differently than the capitalistic way of production and result. The liberation of technology from outputting optimized results allows it to become a means of expression that manifests reality. The process of thinking has to negate capitalistic thinking and postulate a technology of indeterminacy, repositioning us to comment on the nonlinearity of technology. AI provides this possibility by generating more remote associations and answers than norms while it also reinforces existing stereotypes by associating data based on existing social-political structure. I think that the more important question to ask is how to generate diverse citizens' engagement in the data collection process, making the AI training model's data and references visible.

To reflect on the reading, The images created are representations of braiding technology generated through a mid-journey chatbot. With less specific words on human characteristics, space, and gestures, this image attempts to create anonymity that manifests cultural strength and bondage, expressing values of braiding as a significant cultural artifact without pre-described narratives.
