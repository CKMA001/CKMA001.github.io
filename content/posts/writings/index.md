The movie Berlin: symphony of a great city introduces us to a unique set of scenes that depicts a day in the city of Berlin. The movie captures the everyday experience of Berlin yet strangely captures the mundane parts of Berlin with uncanniness. This paper looks at the role of air as a medium, specifically how it sets up or eliminates cultural division through transparency.

From 1:30 to 2:11, the moving camera describes the movement of telephone wires passing by. (1)  With it, a sequence of rapid crosscuts of the railroad and train connectors. In this film entry, no character has been introduced. It inevitably foregrounded the train as a machine moving along the countryside, lacking ethnographic content. We do not know whether it's carrying visitors, who are the visitors, or if it's carrying cargo. As the camera moves along the railroad,  the countryside looms with the blurriness of the fog in the background and the foregrounded steam released from the locomotive engine. While the background of the scene remains foggy due to the moisture in the air, the smog in the foreground is framed such that the source of the smog is unidentifiable in the sequence. It automatically connects the cloud and the steam in the foreground and background. It is as if the railway is elevated from the ground and flying through the countryside. This analogy is confirmed through the rapid crosscuts in which videos of moving telephone wires, the railroad, and the wheels are overlaid. Among these cuts, two points of view shot at different angles pointing toward the cloud are intentionally mingled with the steam released from the steam chest, which occupies the top portion of the screen. Thus, the analogy established through these cuts compositionally softened the difference between cloud and steam since they are both composed of small water droplets and have similar opacity.
