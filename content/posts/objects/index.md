This added on lamp shade is a freeform surface resting on an existing lamp shade. Its geometry derives from the lightness of light fabric. It can be installed on an open lamp shade and its a warmful indirect light can create an ideal ambient light for reading, bedtime stories, or just staring in space. Â
