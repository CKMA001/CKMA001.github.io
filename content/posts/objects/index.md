This added on lamp shade is a freeform surface resting on an existing lamp shade. Its geometry is inspired by the lightness of silk fabric. It can be installed on an open lamp shade while its a warmful light reflection creates an ideal ambient light for reading, bedtime stories, or just staring in space for a more delightful sensual experience.
