In Mass Debilitation and Algorithmic Governance, Jasbir Puar argues that “dividualization
is both digital and of the flesh, involving a series of recursive relationalities, as well as being a way of “unseeing” and reseeing corporeality. ”  The abstraction of space and seeing life as patterns creates forms that seperates of body parts from the whole body. This body/ body parts detached realism became a mental technique for executing dehumanized actions to the subject. The quantification of life into patterns whose form does not relate to the body reconstituted the quality of the data itself. In recalling what Ezekiel Dixon Roman argues that patterns and rhythms can be used as a form of control by quantifying life into patterns and adjusting the speed of that parameter, a person is not in direct relationship to the life and subject itself instead just as the parameter that controls the pattern itself. In this way, pattern becomes a way to execute control over the psyche. One example in case for building industry would be targeted toward construction workers, by visualizing the collective efforts of construction workers in forms of grided panels, in the shape of regular geometries that can be easily identified and quantified, it begins to abstract the collective human effort and time into transport, assembly.
